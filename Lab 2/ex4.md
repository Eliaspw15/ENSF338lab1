1.) We think the best option would be binary search if we are supposed to be assuming we are like a program. 

2.) it would take 4 steps to get to room 128. One step is selecting a midpoint, at the 4th step you would find room 128.

3.) Neither

4.) Worst case is the search key was at the end.(130 or 100 position) 

best case would be in the middle of the dataset, (114 or 116)

5.)Once we memorized the floor plan and realized it was a circle and the greatest room was 138, rooms increased by 2, and it was sorted, we would change the algorithm to a reverse linear search so we start at room 138 and work our way down to room 128.
