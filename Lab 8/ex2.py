# The histograms clearly demonstrate the efficiency improvement gained by using a priority queue (fast method) over a linear search (slow method) in 
# Dijkstra's algorithm. The fast method's execution times are not only substantially lower but also show less variability, suggesting that it performs 
# consistently well regardless of the graph's structure. This efficiency is crucial for large graphs or applications requiring real-time computation 
# of shortest paths.
