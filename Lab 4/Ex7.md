# 1. The provided implementation of a function to reverse a list has a complexity of O(n). Firstly, there isn't a worst, best, or average case as the task is being applied to every element in the same way so the only factor is the size of the list. Moreover, the complexity of the function can be derived from the fact that the function must run for each element of the list. Due to this single for loop, this function has linear complexity.

# 2. Considering the original function has a complexity of O(n), it is doubtful that a function can do the same thing with a lower time complexity function, however some changes made that should make it better performing is removing the call to the linked list methods like get_size and get_element_at_pos and instead simply traversing the array and reassigning links between nodes correctly, still in a single loop but in a simpler implementation. As demonstrated by the plot generated, the optimized function performs much better, so much so, its data would suggest it has a constant complexity (O(1)), however, its use of a loop that iterates through the linked list would suggest it still has some dependance on the length of the linked list even if its difficult to observe.
